# Dart-LoginPage

This simple login page accepts valid username (email id) and password. On clicking login, it displays a dashboard saying "You have successfully logged into the Dashboard". 
Then on clicking logout, it returns to the login page.
On putting invalid username and password the user cannot login.
The page remembers the previously entered username and password.
On clicking on "Forgot password ?" and entering the username (email id) that had previously been used, it generates the password that had been used by that username before.
No functionality has been added to the button "Not a member?Sign Up now" .
